# BIKE PROJECT

Bike-Project is an app that gets the users location from the browser, renders a Google map, creates a request to Google Maps using the users location and then 
creates a request to Travel For London (TFL) for bike information.
Parses the api responses (navigator object) and adds the data (user agent and geolocator data) to the map.
